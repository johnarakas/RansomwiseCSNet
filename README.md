### Abstract 
In this paper, we introduce RANSOMWISE: an ex-
tensive, qualitative, and representative dataset for transaction-
based ransomware wallet detection. RANSOMWISE comprises
10 trusted public ransomware sources, incorporating over 20K
ransomware wallets active between 2015 and 2024, with 136K
transactions in total. We demonstrate the usefulness of our
proposed dataset by extracting aggregated wallet features and
training simple tree-based models, all of which achieve at least
85% accuracy and 78% precision in identifying ransomware
wallets (even with their depth constrained to 3). Moreover,
we enrich our analysis with a time-based evaluation protocol,
highlighting the importance of data collection across years from
multiple sources.
